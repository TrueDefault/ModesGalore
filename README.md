# ModesGalore

ModesGalore is a plugin for Minecraft. The plugin is made using the Spigot 1.12 API, and includes a bunch of "modes" that players can enable to perform special abilities, such as firing explosive arrows. Some of the other features it includes is the ability to see ores that players mine, teleporting to other players with a flash of lightning, and a custom "memes.txt" file.

This is my first Java project, and is what sparked my interest in Java. I add more features to the plugin on my own time.
