# MyFirstPlugin

MyFirstPlugin is a plugin for Minecraft. The plugin is made using the Spigot 1.11.2 API, and is comprised of a bunch of
unrelated commands, Listeners, Runnables (i.e. tasks that execute periodically), and a custom "memes.txt" file.

This is the first Java project that I worked on, and is what sparked my interest in Java. The plugin represents 
about six months of learning Java and Bukkit plugin development.
