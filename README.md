# ModesGalore

ModesGalore is a plugin for Minecraft. The plugin is made using the Spigot 1.12 API, and includes a bunch of "modes" that players can enable to perform special abilities, such as firing explosive arrows. Some of the other features it includes is the ability to see ores that players mine, teleporting to other players with a flash of lightning, and a custom "memes.txt" file.

The Farting, Pooping, Exploding Arrow, and Rainbow Armor modes are based on videos from the YouTube channel JerryVsHarry; specifically, their "Coding with J&H" series (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSV0H7EPl_XNdAjFqSX0WfQSMbc293eOm). The WalkOnSmoke mode was inspired by a donor perk on a Minecraft server I used to frequent.
