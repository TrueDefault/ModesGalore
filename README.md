# MyFirstPlugin

MyFirstPlugin is a plugin for Minecraft. The plugin is made using the Spigot 1.11.2 API, and includes a bunch of
mostly unrelated commands, Listeners that detect events, Runnables that execute tasks periodically, and a custom 
"memes.txt" file.

This is my first Java project, and is what sparked my interest in Java. I add more features to the plugin on my own time.
